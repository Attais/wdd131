            <p>Site Name: Welcome to The Archives, a place where I plan to help World of Warcraft players make the most of their high level dungeons.</p>
            <p>Site Purpose: In this website, I plan on having my home page (index.html) and two example dungeons, being Stonevault (stonevault.html) and Mists of Tirna Scithe (mists.html)</p>
            <p>Scenarios: Most players have issues with boss mechanics and knowing which trash mobs to target. For that reason, those are the two main areas I want to focus on.</p>
            <p>Color Schema: #291720 as an accent color, and #D90368 for backgrounds</p>
            <p>Typography: Mostly Ariel</p>
